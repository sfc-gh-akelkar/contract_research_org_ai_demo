# CRO Demo Transformation Summary
**From Pediatric Hospital Demo to Contract Research Organization Demo**

## Overview

I've successfully transformed the original Snowflake Intelligence demo from a pediatric healthcare focus to a comprehensive contract research organization (CRO) analytics solution tailored for clinical trial operations. This transformation addresses key CRO use cases while maintaining GCP/GLP compliance and focusing on pharmaceutical industry scenarios serving biotechnology and medical device companies.
