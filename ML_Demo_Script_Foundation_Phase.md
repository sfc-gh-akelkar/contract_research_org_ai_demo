## üìã **Foundation Phase - Core ML (15 minutes)**

### **üèóÔ∏è Opening - Platform Foundation (2 minutes)**

**"Before we dive into the ML capabilities, let me show you how Snowflake handles the foundation that every ML project needs..."**

#### **Data Integration Story:**
```sql
-- Show unified data model
SELECT 'Clinical Operations' as domain, COUNT(*) as tables 
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES 
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'CLINICAL_OPERATIONS_SCHEMA'
AND TABLE_NAME LIKE 'DIM_%' OR TABLE_NAME LIKE 'FACT_%'

UNION ALL

SELECT 'ML Models' as domain, COUNT(*) as tables
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES 
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'ML_MODELS';
```

**Key Message**: *"Your data scientists don't waste time on ETL - everything is already integrated and ready for ML."*

### **üéØ Use Case 1: Enrollment Prediction (6 minutes)**

#### **Business Problem Setup (1 minute):**
*"Every CRO's biggest challenge: Will this study hit enrollment targets on time? Let's see how ML can give us predictive insights."*

#### **Show the ML Workflow (3 minutes):**

**1. Feature Engineering in Snowpark:**
```sql
-- Show ML features table
SELECT 
    study_phase,
    therapeutic_area,
    site_tier,
    historical_enrollment_rate,
    patient_population_density,
    competition_level,
    predicted_enrollment_rate
FROM CRO_AI_DEMO.ML_MODELS.ML_ENROLLMENT_FEATURES 
LIMIT 5;
```

**2. Model Training (Demo the simplicity):**
```sql
-- Train the model
CALL CRO_AI_DEMO.ML_MODELS.TRAIN_ENROLLMENT_PREDICTION_MODEL();
```

**3. Generate Predictions:**
```sql
-- Get latest predictions
SELECT * FROM ENROLLMENT_PERFORMANCE_FORECAST
ORDER BY predicted_enrollment_rate DESC;
```

#### **Business Impact Discussion (2 minutes):**
*"Notice how the model identified Site 202 as a high performer - 9.2 subjects/month predicted. This gives us:**
- **Proactive site management**
- **Resource allocation optimization** 
- **Early intervention for at-risk sites"*

**Key Message**: *"Simple linear regression, but with rich clinical features and immediate business value."*

---

### **üéØ Use Case 2: Site Risk Scoring (6 minutes)**

#### **Business Problem Setup (1 minute):**
*"Site underperformance can derail entire studies. Let's see how we can predict and prevent issues before they happen."*

#### **Show the ML Workflow (3 minutes):**

**1. Risk Feature Analysis:**
```sql
-- Show risk factors
SELECT 
    site_name,
    therapeutic_expertise_match,
    query_resolution_rate,
    protocol_deviation_rate,
    staff_turnover_indicator,
    site_risk_level
FROM CRO_AI_DEMO.ML_MODELS.ML_SITE_PERFORMANCE_FEATURES f
JOIN DIM_SITES s ON f.site_id = s.site_id;
```

**2. Model Training:**
```sql
-- Train risk scoring model
CALL CRO_AI_DEMO.ML_MODELS.TRAIN_SITE_RISK_SCORING_MODEL();
```

**3. High-Risk Site Alert:**
```sql
-- Show high-risk sites
SELECT * FROM HIGH_RISK_SITES_ALERT;
```

#### **Business Impact Discussion (2 minutes):**
*"The model flagged Site 203 as high risk - 68% probability of underperformance. Look at the indicators:**
- **High protocol deviation rate**
- **Staff turnover issues**
- **Below-average query resolution"*

**Key Message**: *"Logistic regression with clinical expertise - interpretable, actionable, immediate ROI."*

---

### **ü§ñ ML-Enhanced Natural Language Queries (1 minute)**

#### **Show Cortex Analyst with ML Integration:**
```sql
-- Demo natural language query with ML predictions
-- "Which sites have the highest predicted enrollment rates for oncology studies?"
-- "Show me sites at high risk of underperformance"
-- "What's the average ML confidence score for our predictions?"
```

**Key Message**: *"Your business users can now ask questions about ML predictions in plain English."*
