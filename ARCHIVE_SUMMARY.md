## What Was Archived

### Notebooks (Removed from main)
- **CRO_ML_Complete_Technical_Demo.ipynb**
  - 61 cells total
  - Combined technical deep dive + customer demo
  - Issue: Too complex for customer walkthrough
  - Preserved in archive for reference

### Documentation (Removed from main)
- **ML_NOTEBOOK_GUIDE.md**
  - Complete guide for using the 61-cell notebook
  - Cell-by-cell breakdown
  - Demo timing guidance

- **ML_Demo_Script_Foundation_Phase.md**
  - Detailed demo script for ML Foundation phase
  - Talking points and Q&A
  - ROI calculations

### SQL Scripts (Removed from main)
- **sql_scripts/05_ml_foundation_phase_setup.sql**
  - ML_MODELS schema creation
  - Feature tables (100-200 records)
  - Snowpark ML stored procedures
  - Model registry and predictions
  - Issue: Complex setup, stored procedures buried model logic

## What Was Cleaned Up

### Files Modified
1. **sql_scripts/03_semantic_views_setup.sql**
   - Removed: `ML_ENHANCED_CLINICAL_VIEW` (third semantic view)
   - Kept: `CLINICAL_OPERATIONS_VIEW` and `BUSINESS_DEVELOPMENT_VIEW`

2. **sql_scripts/04_agent_setup.sql**
   - Removed: "Query ML-Enhanced Clinical Data" tool
   - Kept: 2 Cortex Analyst tools + 3 Cortex Search tools

3. **sql_scripts/00_complete_cro_setup.sql**
   - Updated from 5 scripts to 4 scripts
   - Removed ML-specific value propositions

## What Remains (CRO Demo Foundation)

### Core Infrastructure ‚úÖ
- ‚úì Database and tables (Clinical Operations, Business Dev, Regulatory)
- ‚úì Sample CRO data (Studies, Sites, Enrollment, Safety Events)
- ‚úì Cortex Search for documents (Regulatory, Operations, Business)
- ‚úì 2 Semantic Views for natural language queries
- ‚úì AI Agent with Cortex Analyst + Cortex Search
- ‚úì Demo scripts and ERDs

### Ready For
- ‚úì Basic CRO Intelligence demo (Cortex Analyst + Search)
- ‚úì Natural language queries on clinical operations
- ‚úì Document search and analysis
- ‚úì Clean foundation for NEW ML demo

---

## Why Archive?

### Problem Identified
The ML demo evolved into a **61-cell notebook** that:
- Mixed simple and advanced ML techniques
- Included both Linear Regression AND Random Forest
- Had deployment workflow scattered across cells
- Was difficult to navigate during live demo
- Overwhelmed the core story

### Customer Feedback
> "I don't like this notebook. It's become overly complicated and will not be easy to walk through with the customer."

### Solution
1. ‚úÖ Archive all ML work in dedicated branch
2. ‚úÖ Clean main branch back to CRO foundation
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è **Next:** Build focused ML demo (~25-30 cells) based on customer's detailed requirements

---

## Next Steps: New ML Demo

### Customer Requirements
**Use Case:** Accelerating Clinical Trials with AI-Powered Recruitment  
**Target Audience:** Medpace Data Science & Clinical Operations Teams  
**Duration:** 40 minutes  

### Demo Flow (Planned)
1. **Business Problem** (3 min) - Patient recruitment pain points
2. **Data Exploration** (5 min) - SQL queries on CRO data
3. **Feature Engineering** (5 min) - SQL + Python hybrid
4. **Model Training** (10 min) - scikit-learn/XGBoost with Snowpark
5. **Model Validation** (5 min) - Metrics + feature importance
6. **Deployment** (7 min) - Batch predictions ‚Üí SQL tables
7. **Business Value** (5 min) - SQL insights + ROI

### Key Principles
- ‚úì **One clear story** - Site risk prediction end-to-end
- ‚úì **Linear progression** - No jumping around
- ‚úì **25-30 cells max** - Easy to follow
- ‚úì **SQL ‚Üí Python ‚Üí Production** - Complete workflow
- ‚úì **Demo-ready** - Can present in 30-40 minutes
