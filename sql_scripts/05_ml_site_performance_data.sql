ðŸŽ¯ ML DEMO DATA SETUP

This script creates sample site performance data for the ML demo:
- SITE_PERFORMANCE_FEATURES: 150 sites with 12 engineered features
- Realistic distribution: 50 High, 60 Medium, 40 Low performers
- Features designed for classification and regression ML models

ðŸ“‹ **USAGE:**
Run this script after completing the core CRO setup (scripts 01-04)
