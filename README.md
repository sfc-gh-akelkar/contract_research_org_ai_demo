```sql
-- Run the master setup script in Snowflake worksheet
/sql_scripts/00_complete_cro_setup.sql
```

**Option B: Step-by-Step Modular Setup**
```sql
-- Step 1: Data Infrastructure (Database, tables, sample data)
/sql_scripts/01_cro_data_setup.sql

-- Step 2: Document Intelligence (Cortex Search services)
/sql_scripts/02_cortex_search_setup.sql
/sql_scripts/02a_cro_documents_data.sql  -- Load document data

-- Step 3: Natural Language Queries (Semantic views)
/sql_scripts/03_semantic_views_setup.sql
